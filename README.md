# Telemetry-unpacking-functions
Python dictionary of the lambda functions used to parse telemetry data.

Please follow these guidelines when making parsing rules:

1. Preferrably use a Python IDE (or even Notepad++) to get correct indentations and syntax so RA won't crash
2. Only capitalize abbreviations and first letters, and use underscores instead of whitespaces.
3. Use common sense and make our job easier 

since no one reads this, anyone know of a good pr0n site?
